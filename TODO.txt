## Todo
CON-2 Undo feature for inputs messed up on.
	More complicated than simply saving an array, because the cards are changed
	during it. May have to save the card and automatically account for editing
	as well.

	So, I'll first save the card's previous state, then save the deck.

CON-4 Enable ctrl-L (reloads the display).

CON-5 Create a concards lock file.
	Don't want concards editing the same files at the same time.
	Make sure that if files aren't being used that were passed in are returned
	to the pool of availability or whatever.

CON-6 Create a daily progress file.
	Concards can keep track of your stats each day. How many cards were
	completed and so on.

CON-7 Create Info Command with file name.
	It needs to show the file the card came from for now.

CON-8 Enable Control-C and Control-Z
	It is getting pesky without those.

## Done
CON-1 Fix character wrapping.
	This includes help and double width characters for question group and
	answer.

CON-3 Check tabs (if they work/what they do).
	They are just removed at some point when displaying.
