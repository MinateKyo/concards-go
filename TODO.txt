## Todo
CON-4 Enable ctrl-L (reloads the display).

CON-5 Create a concards lock file.
	Don't want concards editing the same files at the same time.
	Make sure that if files aren't being used that were passed in are returned
	to the pool of availability or whatever.

CON-6 Create a daily progress file.
	Concards can keep track of your stats each day. How many cards were
	completed and so on.

CON-7 Create Info Command with file name.
	It needs to show the file the card came from for now.

CON-8 Enable Control-C and Control-Z
	It is getting pesky without those.

CON-9 Piping support.
	This would just be able to format the file(s) into a nice concard format. I
	would have to think about the functionality of this a bit more.

CON-10 Create a man page.

CON-11 Create an AUR package.

CON-13 Get rid of all BOM markers.

CON-14 Have undo and redo not refresh the card on the screen.

CON-15 Have the ability to see where in the file the card was, or line number
	or something. Maybe prerequisite cards could help out with this idea.

CON-17 Allow the ability to delete a card.

## Done
CON-1 Fix character wrapping.
	This includes help and double width characters for question group and
	answer.

CON-2 Undo feature for inputs messed up on.
	More complicated than simply saving an array, because the cards are changed
	during it. May have to save the card and automatically account for editing
	as well.

CON-3 Check tab characters (if they work/what they do).
	They are just removed at some point when displaying.

CON-12 Error: File "" had no cards in it.
	Concards needs to get rid of BOM for files. I hotfixed it, so it gets rid of
	UTF-8 BOM now :).

CON-16 Fix the bug with something staying being memorized. The bug comes from
	editing the card while reviewing it. Editing it must revert the date or
	something.

CON-18 Fix the % MISSING bug.
