## Todo
CON-4 Enable ctrl-L (reloads the display).
CON-2 Undo feature for inputs messed up on.
	More complicated than simply saving an array, because the cards are changed
	during it. May have to save the card and automatically account for editing
	as well.

## Done
CON-1 Fix character wrapping.
	This includes help and double width characters for question group and
	answer.

CON-3 Check tabs (if they work/what they do).
	They are just removed at some point when displaying.
